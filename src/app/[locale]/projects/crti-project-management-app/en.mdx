## ResearchX - Project Management Application for Researchers

**Client:** Research centre in Industrial Technologies -CRTI-  
**Type:** Web Application  
**Technologies:** Laravel, MySQL, Redis, Vite, React.js

ResearchX was built to facilitate seamless collaboration between researchers, project contributors, and review boards. It provides a clear structure for project version management, task tracking, and collaboration, ensuring that every research project passes through necessary stages with minimal friction. Whether it’s submitting a new project, reviewing suggested revisions, or managing day-to-day tasks, ResearchX offers a complete solution tailored to the specific needs of research professionals.

**Key Features:**

1. **Project Submission & Version Control:**  
   Researchers can submit their project proposals. Once submitted, members can suggest revisions, and project creators can review and accept or reject these suggestions, providing complete control over the project’s evolution.

2. **Collaborative Review Process:**  
   The platform integrates with a scientific review board (Conseil Scientifique) to evaluate the feasibility and relevance of the research. The board has the authority to accept, reject, or halt projects at any stage, adding a formal and structured review process.

3. **Task Management with Kanban:**  
   Research teams can manage their tasks with a Kanban system, allowing users to start, suspend, cancel, or complete tasks. Each action is documented, with reasons provided for suspended or canceled tasks and detailed reports required for completed tasks.

4. **Role-Based Permissions:**  
   The platform supports role-based permissions for different project members. Project creators, contributors, and board reviewers each have specific rights, ensuring security and appropriate access levels.

5. **Automated Notifications:**  
   ResearchX ensures that members are always updated on project progress with automated notifications for task updates, version changes, and board decisions.

6. **Comprehensive Reporting:**  
   Project and task reports are generated for better tracking, allowing research institutions to monitor the project's status, task completion rates, and ongoing activities. This feature enhances accountability and transparency throughout the research lifecycle.

7. **Board Review Flow:**  
   Projects must pass through a formal board review, where they can either be approved or rejected. Accepted projects are allowed to proceed, while rejected or halted ones require further revisions or termination.
